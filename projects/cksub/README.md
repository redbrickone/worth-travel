# CKsub is a Foundation Subtheme we made and made better!

## How to use
1. Download and put in `sites/all/themes/` directory
2. `cd` into theme
3. run `nvm use` if you don't have [nvm get it here](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
4. now type `npm install` this should take awhile and you'll get lots of good stuff.
5. If everything worked properly running `grunt` should do it.

## Suggestions
* Change the theme name the `.info` file.
  * if you do this I also suggest changing the themename variables in the `Gruntfile.js` & the css/scss & js filenames

## TODO
* I'm pretty sure that eslint will fail when you do the `Drupal.settings` in your `js` files
  * When this happens just turn off eslint and yell and me (Josh) and make me fix it
